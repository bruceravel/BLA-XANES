High resolution spectroscopy using Bent Laue Analyzers
======================================================

This document explains the use of software developed to process the
data generated by the spectrometer built by Jeremy Kropf at the `MRCAT
beamline <http://mrcat.iit.edu/>`_ at Sector 10 at the `Advanced
Photon Source <https://www1.aps.anl.gov/>`_.

This spectrometer uses a bent Laue analyzer to disperse an emission
line from a sample onto the face of a `Dectris Pilatus photon-counting
area detector <https://www.dectris.com/pilatus3-r-s-and-x.html>`_, as
shown in this photo:
