SYNOPSIS
       use Xray::BLA; # automatically turns on strict and warnings

       my $spectrum = Xray::BLA->new;

       $spectrum->read_ini("config.ini"); # set attributes from ini file
       $spectrum->stub('myscan');
       $spectrum->energy(9713);

       $spectrum->mask(verbose=>1, write=>0, animate=>0);
       $spectrum->scan(verbose=>1);

    Xray::BLA imports "warnings" and "strict" by default.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is an engine for converting a series of tiff images
    collected using a bent Laue analyzer and a Pilatus 100K area detector
    into a high energy resolution XANES spectrum. A HERFD measurement
    consists of a related set of files from the measurement:

    1.  A column data file containing the energy, signals from other
        scalars, and a few other columns

    2.  A tiff image of an exposure at each energy point. This image must be
        interpreted to be the HERFD signal at that energy point.

    3.  A set of one or more exposures taken at incident energies around the
        peak of the fluorescence line (e.g. Lalpha1 for an L3 edge, etc).
        These exposures are used to make masks for interpreting the sequence
        of images at each energy point.

    Attributes for specifying the paths to the locations of the column data
    files ("scanfolder") and the tiff files ("tiffolder", "tifffolder" with
    3 "f"'s is an alias)) are typically set from an ini-style configuration
    file.

    Assumptions are made about the names of the files in those locations.
    Each files is built upon a stub, indicated by the "stub" attribute. If
    "stub" is "Aufoil", then the column data in "scanfolder" file is named
    Aufoil.001. The tiff images at each energy point are called
    Aufoil_NNNNN.tif where "NNNNN" is the index of the energy point. One of
    the columns in the scan file contains this index so it is unambiguous
    which tiff image corresponds to which energy point. Finally, the elastic
    exposures are called Aufoil_elastic_EEEE_#####.tif where "EEEE" is the
    incident energy and "#####" is the numeric counter for the tiff images.
    For instance, an exposure at the peak of the gold Lalpha1 line would be
    called Aufoil_elastic_9713_00001.tif.

    If you use a different naming convention, this software in its current
    form will break! See "BUGS AND LIMITATIONS".

    This software also makes assumptions about the content of the scan file.
    The columns are expected to come in a certain order. If the order of
    columns chnages, the HERFD will still be measured and recorded properly,
    but the remaining columns in the output files may be misidentified. If
    the first column is not energy, all bets are off.

    This software uses an image handling back to interact with these two
    sets of tiff images. Since the Pilatus writes rather unusual tiff files
    with signed 32 bit integer samples, not every image handling package can
    deal gracefully with them. I have found two choices in the perl universe
    that work well, Imager and "Image::Magick", although using Image::Magick
    requires recompilation to be able to use 32 bit sample depth. Happily,
    Imager works out of the box, so I am using it.

    The signed 32 bit tiffs are imported using Imager and immediately
    stuffed into a PDL object. All subsequent work is done using PDL.

ATTRIBUTES
    "stub"
        The basename of the scan and image files. The scan file is called
        "<stub>.001", the image files are called "<stub>_NNNNN.tif", and the
        processed column data files are called "<stub>_<energy>.001".

    "element"
        The element of the absorber. This is currently only used when making
        the energy v. pixel map. This can be a two-letter element symbol, a
        Z number, or an element name in English (e.g. Au, 79, or gold).

    "line"
        The measured emission line. This is currently only used when making
        the energy v. pixel map. This can be a Siegbahn (e.g. La1 or
        Lalpha1) or IUPAC symbol (e.g. L3-M5).

    "scanfile"
        The fully resolved path to the scan file, as determined from "stub"
        and "scanfolder".

    "scanfolder"
        The folder containing the scan file. The scan file name is
        constructed from the value of "stub".

    "tiffolder"
        The folder containing the image files. The image file names are
        constructed from the value of "stub". "tifffolder" (with 3 "f"'s) is
        an alias.

    "tiffcounter"
        The counter appended to the name of each tiff image. By default the
        EPICS camera interface appends "#####" to the tiff filename. Since
        one image is measured at each energy, 00001 is appended, resulting
        in a name like Aufoil1_elastic_9713_00001.tif. If you have
        configured the camserver to use a different length string or had you
        data acquisition software use a different string altogether, you can
        specify it with this attribute. Note, though, that this software is
        not very clever about these file names -- it makes strict
        assumptions about the format of the tif file name.

    "outfolder"
        The folder to which the processed file is written. The processed
        file name is constructed from the value of "stub".

    "energy"
        This normally takes the tabulated value of the measured fluorescence
        line. For example, for the the gold L3 edge experiment, the L alpha
        1 line is likely used. It's tabulated value is 9715 eV.

        The image containing the data measured from the elastic scattering
        with the incident energy at this energy will have a file name
        something like <stub>_elsatic_<energy>_00001.tif.

        This value can be changed to some other measured elastic energy in
        order to scan the off-axis portion of the spectrum.

        "peak_energy" is an alias for "energy".

    "incident"
        The incident energy for an XES slice through the RIXS or for
        evaluation of single HERFD data point. If not specified, it defaults
        to the midpoint of the energy scan.

    "nincident"
        The index of the incident energy for an XES slice through the RIXS
        or for evaluation of single HERFD data point. If not specified, it
        defaults to the midpoint of the energy scan.

    "steps"
        This contains a reference to an array of steps to be taken for mask
        creation. For example, if the configuration file contains the
        following:

           ## areal algorithm
           [steps]
           steps = <<END
           bad 400 weak 0
           areal median radius 2
           END

        then the lines beginning with "bad" and "areal" will be the entries
        in the array, indicating that first bad and weak pixels will be
        removed using the specifies values for "bad_pixel_value" and
        "weak_pixel_value", then an areal median of radius 2 will be
        computed.

    "operation" [median]
        Setting this to "mean" changes the areal median algorithm to an
        areal mean algorithm.

    "bad_pixel_value" [400]
        In the first pass over the elastic image, spuriously large pixel
        values -- presumably indicating the locations of bad pixels -- are
        removed from the image by setting them to 0. This is the cutoff
        value above which a pixel is assumed to be a bad one.

    "weak_pixel_value" [3]
        In the first pass over the elastic image, small valued pixels are
        removed from the image. These pixels are presumed to have been
        illuminated by a small number of stray photons not associated with
        the imagining of photons at the peak energy. Pixels with fewer than
        this n umber of counts are set to 0.

    "lonely_pixel_value" [3]
        In the second pass over the elastic image, illuminated pixels with
        fewer than this number of illuminated neighboring pixels are removed
        from the image. This serves the purpose of removing most stray
        pixels not associated with the main image of the peak energy.

        This attribute is ignored by the areal median/mean algorithm.

    "social_pixel_value" [2]
        In the third pass over the elastic image, dark pixels which are
        surrounded by larger than this number of illuminated pixels are
        presumed to be a part of the image of the peak energy. They are
        given a value of 5 counts. This serves the propose of making the
        elastic image a solid mask with few gaps in the image of the main
        peak.

        This attribute is ignored by the areal median/mean algorithm.

    "radius" [2]
        This determines the size of the square used in the areal median/mean
        algorithm. A value of 1 means to use a 3x3 square, i.e. 1 pixel in
        each direction. A value of 2 means to use a 5x5 square. Thanks to
        PDL, the hit for using a larger radius is quite small.

    "elastic_file"
        This contains the name of the elastic image file. It is constructed
        from the values of "stub", "energy", and "tiffolder".

    "elastic_image"
        This contains the PDL of the elastic image.

    "npixels"
        The number of illuminated pixels in the mask. That is, the number of
        pixels contributing to the HERFD signal.

    "columns"
        When the elastic file is read, this is set with the number of
        columns in the image. All images in the measurement are presumed to
        have the same number of columns. "width" is an alias for "columns".

    "rows"
        When the elastic file is read, this is set with the number of rows
        in the image. All images in the measurement are presumed to have the
        same number of rows. "height" is an alias for "rows".

    "colored"
        This flag should be true to write colored text to the screen when
        methods are called with the verbose flag on.

    "screen"
        This flag should be true when run from the command line so that
        progress messages are written to the screen.

METHODS
    All methods return an object of type Xray::BLA::Return. This object has
    two attributes: "status" and "message". A successful return will have a
    positive definite "status". Any reporting (for example exception
    reporting) is done via the "message" attribute.

    Some methods, for example "apply_mask", use the return "status" as the
    sum of HERFD counts from the illuminated pixels.

  API
    "read_ini"
        Import an ini-style configuration file to set attributes of the
        Xray::BLA object.

          $spectrum -> read_ini("myconfig.ini");

    "mask"
        Create a mask from the elastic image measured at the energy given by
        "energy".

          $spectrum->mask(verbose=>0, save=>0, animate=>0);

        When true, the "verbose" argument causes messages to be printed to
        standard output with information about each stage of mask creation.

        When true, the "save" argument causes a tif file to be saved at each
        stage of processing the mask.

        When true, the "animate" argument causes a properly scaled animation
        to be written showing the stages of mask creation.

        These output image files are gif.

        This method is a wrapper around the contents of the "step"
        attribute. Each entry in "step" will be parsed and executed in
        sequence.

        See Xray::BLA::Mask

    "scan"
        Rewrite the scan file with a column containing the HERFD signal as
        computed by applying the mask to the image file from each data
        point.

          $spectrum->scan(verbose=>0, xdiini=>$inifile);

        When true, the "verbose" argument causes messages to be printed to
        standard output about every data point being processed.

        The "xdiini" argument takes the file name of an ini-style
        configuration file for XDI metadata. If no ini file is supplied,
        then no metadata and no column labels will be written to the output
        file.

        An Xray::BLA::Return object is returned. Its "message" attribute
        contains the fully resolved file name for the output HERFD data
        file.

    "energy_map"
        Read the masks from each emission energy and interpolate them to
        make a map of pixel vs. energy. This requires that each mask has
        already been generated from the measured elastic image.

          $spectrum -> energy_map(verbose => 1, animate=>0);

        When true, the "verbose" argument causes messages to be printed to
        standard output about file written.

        When true, the "animate" argument causes an animated gif file to be
        written containing a movie of the processed elastic masks.

        The returned Xray::BLA::Return object conveys no information at this
        time.

    "compute_xes"
        Take an XES slice through the RIXS map. Weight the signal at each
        emission energy by the number of pixels illuminated in that mask.

          $spectrum->scan(verbose=>0, xdiini=>$inifile, incident=>$incident);

        The "incident" argument specifies the incident energy of the slice.
        If not given, use the midpoint (by index) of the energy array. If an
        small integer is given, use that incident energy point. If an energy
        value is given, use that energy or the nearest larger energy.

        When true, the "verbose" argument causes messages to be printed to
        standard output about file written.

        The returned Xray::BLA::Return object conveys no information at this
        time.

    "get_incident"
        Given an integer (representing a data point index) or an energy
        value, set the "incident" and "nincident" attributes with the
        matching energy and index values of that point.

            $spectrum->get_incident($point);

        If $point is omitted, the "incident" and "nincident" attributes are
        set with the values of the midpoint (by index) of the data range.

  Internal methods
    All of these methods return a Xray::BLA::Return object, which has two
    attributes, and integer "status" to indicate the return status (1 is
    normal in all cases here) and an string "message" containing a short
    description of the exception (an empty string indicates no exception).

    See Xray::BLA::Mask for details about the mask generation steps.

    "check"
        Confirm that the scan file and elastic image taken from the values
        of "stub" and "energy" exist and can be read.

        This is the first thing done by the "mask" method and must be the
        initial chore of any script using this library.

          $spectrum -> check;

    "apply_mask"
        Apply the mask to the image for a given data point to obtain the
        HERFD signal for that data point.

          $spectrum -> apply_mask($tif_number, verbose=>1)

        The "status" of the return object contains the photon count from the
        image for this data point.

MASK SPECIFICATION SYNTAX
    The steps to mask creation are specified using a simple imperative
    language. Here's an example of specifying the steps via the
    configuration file:

        [steps]
        steps = <<END
        bad 400 weak 0
        multiply by 5
        areal mean radius 2
        bad 400 weak 6
        lonely 3
        social 2
        END

    Each specification of a step is contained on a single line. White space
    is unimportant, but spelling matters. The parser has little
    intelligence.

    The possible steps are:

    "bad # weak #"
        This specification says to remove bad and weak pixels from the
        image. The first number is the value used for "bad_pixel_value". The
        second number is the value used for "weak_pixel_value".

    "multiply by #"
        This specification says to multiply the image by a constant. That
        is, each pixel will be multiplied by the given constant.

    "areal [median|mean] radius #"
        Apply the areal median or mean algorithm. The number specifies the
        "radius" over which to apply the median or mean. A value of 1 says
        to construct a 3x3 square, i.e. 1 pixel both ways in both
        dimensions, a value of 2 says to construct a 5x5 square, and so on.
        Using this algorithm, the pixel is set to either the median or the
        mean of the pixels in the square.

    "lonely #"
        Turn off a pixel that is not surrounded by enough illuminated
        pixels. The purpose of this is to darken isolated pixels. The number
        is used as the value of "lonely_pixel_value". If a pixel is
        illuminated and is surrounded by fewer than that number of pixels,
        it will be turned off.

    "social #"
        Turn off a pixel that is surrounded by enough illuminated pixels.
        The purpose of this is to illuminate dark pixels in an illuminated
        region. The number is used as the value of "social_pixel_value". If
        a pixel is not illuminated and is surrounded by more than that
        number of pixels, it will be turned on.

    "entire image"
        Set all pixels in the image to 1. That is, use all the pixels in a
        image to generate the XANES value. This is mostly used for testing
        purposes and its incompatible with any of the other steps except the
        bad pixel pass. To examine the XANES form the entire image, use this

            [steps]
            steps = <<END
            bad 400 weak 0
            entire image
            END

    The steps can be specified in any order and repeated as necessary.

    The "steps" attribute is set is a configuration file containing the
    "[steps]" group is read. The "steps" attribute can be manipulated by
    hand:

       $spectrum->steps(\@list_of_steps);      # set the steps to an array

       $spectrum->push_steps("multiply by 7"); # add to the end of the list of steps

       $spectrum->pop_steps;                   # remove the last item from the list

       $spectrum->steps([]); # or
       $spectrum->clear_steps;                 # remove all steps from the list

ERROR HANDLING
    If the scan file or the elastic image cannot be found or cannot be read,
    a program will die with a message to STDERR to that effect.

    If an image file corresponding to a data point cannot be found or cannot
    be read, a value of 0 will be written to the output file for that data
    point and a warning will be printed to STDOUT.

    Any warning or error message involving a file will contain the complete
    file name so that the file naming or configuration mistake can be
    tracked down.

    Missing information expected to be read from the configuration file will
    issue an error citing the configuration file.

    Errors interpreting the contents of an image file are probably not
    handled well.

    The output column data file is not written on the fly, so a run that
    dies or is halted early will probably result in no output being written.
    The save and animation images are written at the time the message is
    written to STDOUT when the "verbose" switch is on.

XDI OUTPUT
    When a configuration file containing XDI metadata is used, the output
    files will be written in XDI format. This is particularly handy for the
    RIXS function. If XDI metadata is provided, then the "BLA.pixel_ratio"
    datum will be written to the output file. This number is computed from
    the number of pixels illuminated in the mask at each emission energy.
    The pixel ratio for an emission energy is the number of pixels from the
    emission energy with the largest number of illuminated pixels divided by
    the number of illuminated pixels at that energy.

    The pixel ratio can be used to normalize the mu(E) data from each
    emission energy. The concept is that the normalized mu(E) data are an
    approximation of what they would be if each emission energy was equally
    represented on the face of the detector.

    The version of Athena based on Demeter will be able to use these values
    as importance or plot multiplier values if the Xray::XDI module is
    available.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    Using the script in the bin/ directory, file locations, elastic
    energies, and mask parameters are specified in an ini-style
    configuration file. An example is found in share/config.ini.

    If using Xray::XDI, metadata can be supplied by an ini-style file. And
    example is found in share/bla.xdi.ini.

DEPENDENCIES
    This requires perl 5.10 or later.
