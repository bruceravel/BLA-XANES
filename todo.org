* BLA-XANES to do list

 + Look into using PDL for image processing.  That should be much
   faster than Image::Magick, if only becuase computation can be
   pushed into PDL rather than done in perl with repeated calls to
   Image::Magick's ~Get~ method.

 + Extensive pods

 + +Generate properly scaled animated gifs for mask development and for+
   +image sequence.  This will require bad pixel removal from the first+
   +image in the mask sequence and from all images in a data set.+

 + Jeremy suggested:

   + Higher weak-pixel cutoff for better energy resolution

   + assigned the median pixel value within a particular radius to each
     point

   + bin with 2x2 or 3x3 bins

 + Interpolate elastic masks so that a single pass over the data can
   be made to generate the "whole" RIXS plane

 + +Automate setting of file names, such as ~elastic_file~+

 + +location and access of ini file for XDI output needs to be more graceful+

 + convert animation file to gif for ease of viewing
